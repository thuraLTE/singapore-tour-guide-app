Singapore Tour Guide app
========================

This app guides users or tourists who need assistance and directions around Singapore. 
There are 6 place categories showcased for users to view, each with a list of various place 
information.

This app consists of multiple fragments composed within a single activity, a ViewPager2 integrated 
with TabLayoutMediator to allow navigation among different fragments, and a recycler view to 
properly handle memory usage on a list of items.
